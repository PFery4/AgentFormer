# A (minimalist) copy of the original AgentFormer source code

in order to compare our implementation of OcclusionFormer with AgentFormer properly, we keep here a copy of [the source code for the original implementation of AgentFormer](https://github.com/Khrylx/AgentFormer) (nothing is modified within the source code presented here, only the paths to imports are modified).

All code from within this directory is directly taken from the original AgentFormer repository.
